### Requirements

- node.js stable


### Instructions

In the [`./client`](./client) directory, first install node dependencies:


```
npm install
```

Next, start a development server with:

```
npm run dev
```

You can then browse to you [`https://localhost:3000`](https://localhost:3000) to view the application.
Due to a self-signed certificate being used for the dev server, you will receive a security warning.
